      status: 'Completed',
      content: `This is a comprehensive inspection report that covers all aspects of the foundation work completed on August 14, 2025. The inspection was conducted following industry standards and safety protocols. All concrete pours were observed and documented. The foundation meets all structural requirements and specifications outlined in the project plans. Quality control measures were implemented throughout the process. No major defects or issues were identified during the inspection. Minor cosmetic issues were noted and addressed immediately. The work progresses according to schedule with no delays expected.`,
      findings: `Concrete strength test results show compliance with design specifications (4000 PSI achieved). Rebar placement and spacing conform to structural drawings. Foundation dimensions are within acceptable tolerances (+/- 1/4 inch). Waterproofing membrane properly installed and inspected. Drainage systems functioning as designed. No honeycombing or cold joints observed. Surface finish is smooth and uniform. Anchor bolts positioned correctly for structural steel placement.`,
      recommendations: `Proceed with backfill operations after 48-hour cure time. Install perimeter drainage before final grading. Apply additional waterproofing coating at specified locations. Schedule structural steel erection for next phase. Continue monitoring concrete cure strength. Document any weather-related delays or impacts. Maintain proper site drainage during construction.`,
